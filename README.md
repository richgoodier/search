# Project: Front-End for Google Search

This repository contains a front-end replica of the Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. This project is part of the [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript) course.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to design and implement a front-end interface that interacts with Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. The user interface mimics the real Google Search's look and feel and the user experience is similar as it utilizes Google's search capabilities.

## Features

- Google Search page: a simple search bar that accepts a query and navigates the user to the Google search results for that query.
- Google Image Search page: a dedicated page for searching images on Google. A query submitted here will navigate the user to the Google Image search results for that query.
- Google Advanced Search page: an interface that offers advanced search options that correspond to Google's own advanced search parameters. Here users can provide inputs for these options:
  - Find pages with… “all these words:”
  - Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
  - Find pages with… “any of these words:”
  - Find pages with… “none of these words:”
- "I'm Feeling Lucky" button: this button takes users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
